# XOmiVAE

This code explains the unsupervised and supervised part of the gene expression variant of OmiVAE, a model developed by Zhang et al., (2019). Paper [link](httpsarxiv.org/abs/1908.06278).

This code adjusts the Deep SHAP explainer model developed by Lundberg et al., (2017). Paper [link](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions). The adjustments enables the Deep SHAP library to explain the latent space of OmiVAE.

For example of how to implement the code, see main.py. The explainable functions are in omiShapExplainer.py.
